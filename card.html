			<div class="description">
			<p>Arctic wolves live in northern Canada, Greenland, Alaska and Iceland. They live in these Arctic regions year-round. Furthermore, these regions have dark periods that last about 5 months. So, Arctic wolves have adapted to living in the dark as well as the cold. Instead of living in dens in the ground, Arctic wolves live in caves or seek shelter in outcroppings of rocks. The ground in these Arctic areas is always frozen making it impossible for them to dig traditional dens.</p>
